Personal portfolio website using Next.js, Typescript, Tailwindcss, Notion as CMS

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Motivation
With so many templates out there, I could actually just do a direct copy-paste without having to create it for 2 weeks. I made this website as motivation to learn Next.js. I am using next.js 13, tailwindcss as the CSS framework, and also some UI references that I used on this website.
