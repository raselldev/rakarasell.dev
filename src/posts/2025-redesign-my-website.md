When I first launched **rakarasell.dev** back in 2021, I was riding the wave of the "hype" tech stack: **NextJS** and **Vercel**. My goal was simple—create a personal website that was cost-effective, easy to deploy, and a platform to showcase my work while learning **TypeScript**. Little did I know, this project would evolve into a journey of continuous learning and improvement.

# The Early Days: From WordPress to NextJS

Initially, I started with a **.com domain** and **WordPress**, thinking it would be the easiest way to get a website up and running. However, I quickly realized that managing WordPress was more complicated than I anticipated. The setup felt overwhelming, and I struggled to customize it to my liking. Frustrated, I decided to take matters into my own hands and build something from scratch.

That’s when I discovered **NextJS** and **Vercel**. The combination of these tools allowed me to create a fast, scalable, and cost-effective website. I was also determined to learn **TypeScript**, so I made it a core part of the project. The initial version of my website was built with **NextJS**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Shadcn UI**, which made development a breeze. These tools helped me quickly prototype and deploy a functional website that served as both a portfolio and a learning platform.

# Why Redesign in 2025?

Fast forward to 2025, and it was time for a refresh. Technology evolves rapidly, and so do design trends. I wanted my website to reflect my growth as a developer and embrace modern design principles. This time, I decided to use **Daisy UI**, a component library built on top of Tailwind CSS. Daisy UI offered a clean, minimalist design system that aligned perfectly with my vision for the redesign.

# The Redesign Process

1.  **Simplifying the Design:**

The new design focuses on simplicity and usability. I removed unnecessary clutter and prioritized a clean, intuitive layout. Daisy UI’s pre-built components made it easy to achieve a polished look without spending hours on custom CSS.

2.  **Improving Performance:**

Performance has always been a priority for me. During the redesign, I optimized images, reduced JavaScript bundle sizes, and implemented lazy loading to ensure the website loads quickly, even on slower connections.

3.  **Enhancing Accessibility:**

Accessibility was another key focus. I ensured the website was fully navigable via keyboard and screen readers, and I used Daisy UI’s built-in accessibility features to improve the overall user experience.

4.  **Adding New Features:**

The redesign also introduced new features, such as a dark mode toggle, a more detailed project showcase, and a blog section (where you’re reading this post!). These additions make the website more functional and engaging for visitors.

# Lessons Learned

This redesign taught me the importance of **iterative improvement**. A website is never truly "finished"—it evolves as you grow. By embracing tools like Daisy UI and staying up-to-date with modern web development practices, I was able to create a website that not only looks great but also performs well and is easy to maintain.

# Looking Ahead

As I continue to grow as a developer, I’m excited to see how **rakarasell.dev** will evolve in the future. Whether it’s experimenting with new technologies, adding more content, or refining the user experience, this website will always be a reflection of my journey.

If you’re thinking about building or redesigning your own website, my advice is simple: start small, embrace the tools that work for you, and don’t be afraid to iterate. The web is constantly changing, and so should your website.
